# Sales Prediction

## Objective
The objective of this project is to predict product sales based on
advertising expenditure across different platforms such as TV, Radio,
and Newspaper.

## Dataset
The dataset includes the following features:
- TV Advertising Budget
- Radio Advertising Budget
- Newspaper Advertising Budget
- Sales (Target variable)

## Approach
1. Data loading and preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Correlation analysis
4. Feature selection
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation

## Models Used
- Linear Regression
- Multiple Linear Regression

## Evaluation Metrics
- R² Score
- Mean Absolute Error (MAE)
- Mean Squared Error (MSE)

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The analysis shows that TV advertising has the strongest impact on sales.
The regression model provides a good fit and can be used to estimate
future sales based on advertising budgets.
