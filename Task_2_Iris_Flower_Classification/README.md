# Iris Flower Classification

## Objective
The objective of this project is to classify iris flowers into three
species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) based on their physical
measurements.

## Dataset
The Iris dataset contains the following features:
- Sepal Length
- Sepal Width
- Petal Length
- Petal Width
- Species (Target variable)

## Approach
1. Data loading and overview
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Visualization of feature relationships
4. Feature scaling
5. Model training
6. Model evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
- Support Vector Machine (SVM)

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Classification Report
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The Iris dataset is well-structured and linearly separable.
Models such as Logistic Regression and SVM achieve high accuracy,
making them suitable choices for this classification task.
