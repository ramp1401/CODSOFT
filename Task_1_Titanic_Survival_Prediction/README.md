# Titanic Survival Prediction
# Titanic Survival Prediction

## Objective
The goal of this project is to predict whether a passenger survived the
Titanic disaster based on various features such as age, gender,
passenger class, fare, and embarkation port.

## Dataset
The dataset contains passenger information including:
- Passenger Class (Pclass)
- Sex
- Age
- Number of siblings/spouses aboard (SibSp)
- Number of parents/children aboard (Parch)
- Fare
- Embarked Port
- Survival Status (Target variable)

## Approach
1. Data loading and inspection
2. Handling missing values (Age, Embarked)
3. Encoding categorical variables
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Feature selection
6. Model training
7. Model evaluation

## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## Evaluation Metrics
- Accuracy Score
- Confusion Matrix

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## Conclusion
The trained model is able to predict passenger survival with reasonable
accuracy. Feature importance analysis shows that gender, passenger
class, and fare play a significant role in survival prediction.
